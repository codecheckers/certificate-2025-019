summary: >
  Figures 3-8 from the manuscript were successfully reproduced. Figures 1-2 and Tables 1-3 were not covered by this CODECHECK. To avoid the lengthy execution time required to run the full experiments, the pre-computed results used to generate the figures were provided in a separate repository.
